## RADIATION AND NATURAL CONVECTION
In this project I Used surface to surface model in ANSYS Fluent to model a 3-D room with one heated wall and the room is subjected to radiative and convective heat transfer to the surrounding and computed the temperature patterns inside the room and wall heat flux

## Multi-phase Modeling and Simulation 
Modeled melting of phase change material using solidification liquefaction model in ANSYS Fluent
Reduced the Mushy zone using advanced and adaptive meshing technique
