## Simulation of a Battery Cell Using Multi-Scale Multi-Dimensional Model (MSMD) in ANSYS Fluent
The discharge behavior of a lithium-ion battery ismodeled using Newman, Tiedemann, Gu and Kim (NTGK)
model. The battery is a 14.6 Ah LG Chem LiMn2O4 cathode and graphite anode battery. The results
show that surface monitor plot of discharge curve at 1 C has a decreasing trend and volume monitor plot
of maximum temperature in the domain has slightly increasing pattern over the simulation time. For the
curves of discharge and maximum temperature in the domain, lowest and the highest rate of changes
were seen for O.5 C and 5 C respectively.
