## Flow Classification Using Machine Learning
Classified the following flow as NRe driven flow "ascending flow", NFr driven flow "draining flow" and a mixture "mixed flow" using machine learning.
Developed a fuzzy c mean clustering code using python to classify the flow type.

<em>Result</em>

Class "0" represents mixed flow, class "1" represent ascending flow and class "2" as draining flow.

## Asymptotic (Perturbation) solution of an oscillator
A comparision is made between the exact solution and an asymptotic solution generated using Mathematica to solve the linear oscillator weak damping equation.
